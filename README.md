# Ikea Furniture-SQL Project

IKEA is a Swedish furniture retail company that designs and sells high-quality and affordable ready-to-assemble furniture and home appliances.
The main purpose of the database created in the project is to identify the functionalities offered by the e-commerce platform of the furniture company IKEA. This involves day-to-day operations such as user, inventory, product, logistics, and payment management.

IKEA has a very unique business model, providing a very family-friendly shopping experience, sustainable products, do-it-yourself assembly of products, and also has delicious food. The commerce that goes behind such a successful and revolutionary business model was very intriguing to me.

Ecommerce marketplaces have been on the rise around the world since the early 1900s and continue to be the most user-friendly way to shop. IKEA alone experienced a 30% hike in its sales after the introduction of its e-commerce platform. Thus, I choose the e-commerce platform of the furniture retail giant IKEA as our database
model.

A detailed description of the project is available in the project report which explains the ER and EER diagram along with SQL code for creating the database and few SQL queries to extract relavent information from the database. 

My project report contains : 

##### > Description of Entities and Attributes
##### > Business rules linking various entities of IKEA
##### > EER diagram showing the relationship between the entities
##### > Relational Model 
##### > Data Normalization : 3NF ralational model
##### > Creation of Database and Tables 
##### > Insert Queries for entering data into the table
##### > Research question and answer to extract relavent information from the database

I have also attached a separate SQL file which has detailed queries and comments used in the porject

This project was a part of my Data Management for Analytics course at SFSU-MSBA program
